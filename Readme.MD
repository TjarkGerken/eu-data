# Meer, M√§rkte, Mobilit√§t: EU Klimarisiko-Bewertung

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive climate-risk assessment framework for European regions with advanced geospatial analysis and interactive data visualization. The project investigates opportunities for the EU in the field of data science through evidence-based climate-risk analysis.

### Central Research Question

**‚ÄúWhere are the opportunities for the EU in the field of data science?‚Äù**

This question is addressed by developing a climate-risk assessment system that combines the following components:

- Multi-scenario modeling of sea-level rise  
- Quantification of economic impacts  
- Interactive web-based data storytelling  
- Advanced geospatial data processing  

## Project Outcomes

- **Data Story**: An interactive web application for visualizing the climate-risk analysis

## System Components

### üî¨ [EU Climate Risk Assessment Framework](./eu_climate/README.md)

A comprehensive Python-based geospatial analysis framework with a four-layer climate-risk assessment approach:

- **Hazard Layer**: Sea-level-rise scenarios and coastal flood modeling  
- **Exposure Layer**: Building-density and population-exposure analysis  
- **Relevance Layer**: Assessment of economic factors (GDP, freight, human capital)  
- **Risk Layer**: Integrated multi-scenario risk evaluation based on selected factors  
- **Advanced Features**: Cluster analysis, economic-impact quantification, web-optimized outputs  

**Core Capabilities:**

- Multi-scenario analysis (currently up to 15 m sea-level rise)  
- Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) generation  
- Automated data-processing pipelines with Hugging Face integration  
- Economic-impact analysis for GDP, freight, and human resources  

### üåê [Data Story Web Application](./data-story-web/README.md)

An interactive Next.js application with comprehensive data-story visualization and full admin management:

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic maps and charts  
- **Admin Panel**: Complete content-management system for stories and references  
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudflare R2 integration with support for large geospatial files  

**Technical Features:**

- Supabase database integration  
- Support for large geospatial file formats (.tif, .cog, .mbtiles)  
- Advanced image and reference management  

## Project Goals

Based on the project briefing, the following core requirements were defined:

- **Evidence-Based Storytelling**: Developing a robust, data-driven narrative on EU climate risks  
- **Data-Science Methodology**: Applying advanced geospatial analysis and machine-learning techniques  
- **Compelling Presentation**: Technically sound and visually appealing result presentation  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Web-optimized outputs for policy and research applications
