# Naming Things Right

> “There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.”

## 📌 Rule Summary

Avoid bad naming patterns by:
- **No Single-Letter Variables:** Use descriptive names instead.
- **Never Abbreviate:** Write out names fully for clarity.
- **Skip Type Prefixes:** Avoid Hungarian notation and similar patterns.
- **Include Units When Needed:** For example, use `delaySeconds` to indicate units.
- **Use Specific, Meaningful Names:** Avoid generic names like “Utils”, “Base”, or “Abstract.” Instead, group related functions into well-named modules or classes and name them based on their purpose.

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Expressiveness Over Brevity:** Code is read more often than written; let names do the explaining.
- **Clarity Over Convention:** Don't hide essential context in abbreviations.
- **Let Types Do the Talking:** In statically typed languages, rely on the type system instead of embedding type hints in names.

When in doubt, favor clarity—even if it means typing a few extra characters.
